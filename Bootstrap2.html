It is a high-energy game requiring quick reflexes and, unlike tennis, <pre>the shuttlecock must be kept in the air without touching the ground. </pre>  <code>The best age to start badminton training generally falls between 5 and 8 years old</code> <abbr>A player should not reach over the net to hit the shuttlecock.</abbr> The first side to 21 points wins a game.

If the score is 20-20, a side must win by two clear points to win the game.</blockquote> A
